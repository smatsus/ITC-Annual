\subsection{研究報告（李 ソ賢）}


【Background】　The intracellular movements of small organelles in a living cell contain key information for developing pharmaceuticals, in that various pathological processes such as virus infection involves the internal transport. Although precise physical properties of the cargo carrier's motion have been elucidated by previous studies, analysis on the pattern of the organelle transport and the whole cell-level are not yet clearly understood.

【Achievements】　We presented a new approach to analyzing the movement pattern of the intracellular transport focusing on the transfer motion of the organelles, and the quantitative method to evaluate the endocytic motions at the whole-cell level. First, we developed a combined optical flow with cell center estimation method, to visualize the overall organelle movement with respect to the cell center, which reveals the relation between organelles and the motor proteins. Second, a machine learning approach for classifying the type of transfer that occurred in the intracellular transport was presented.
